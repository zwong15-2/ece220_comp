Write the missing lines and for-loop in the 'main' function in sin_func.c The
objective of this lab so is to introduce IO and simple programming with C.

main:
Print and prompt the users for the values of (n, omega1, omega2) in that order.
Using the values and following the alorithm below, print a sequence of n pairs
of (x, f(x)).

The algorithm is as follows:
- for i in [0, n-1]
    - x_i = i * \pi / n
    - f(x) = sin(omega1 * x_i) + 1 / 2 * sin(omega2 * x_i)

Execution:
To run the program, type './bin/sin_func' and enter the 3 values when prompted
to do so.
