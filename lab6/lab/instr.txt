Instructions
************
Implement a vector in C. You will have to implement the 6 functions found in
vector.c.

createVector(int initialSize):
Creates a 'vector' of size 'initialSize'

destroyVector(vector_t *vector):
Frees 'vector' and any associated allocated data inside the 'vector'

resize(vector_t *vector):
Resizes the 'vector' to be twice as big as before

push_back(vector_t *vector, int element):
Adds 'element' to the back of 'vector'

pop_back(vector_t *vector):
Removes the last element from 'vector' and returns it

access(vector_t *vector, int index):
Returns 'vector[index]' or 0 if out of bounds

Execution:
Run ./bin/vector
