Instructions
************
Implement an algorithm to find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of a binary
search tree (BST). You will have to implement the 'lowest_common_ancestor'
function.

lowest_common_ancestor(NODE *root, int first_number, int second_number):
Find the lowest common ancestor of two nodes containing the {first,
second}_number. Hint, think how a BST is organized because this simplifies the
algorithm quite a bit.

Execution:
Run ./bin/lca and follow the on-screen prompts.
