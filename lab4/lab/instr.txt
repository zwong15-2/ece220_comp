Instructions
************
Write code to simulate rolling six-sided dice. You will need to implement the
'roll_three' function in dice.c and implement the 'main' function in main.c.

main:
Follow the steps listed below to implement the 'main' function
- Prompt the user for a seed value
- Read an integer using scanf
- Call the srand function using the input integer
- Call 'roll_three' function and print the results

roll_three:
Roll three six-sided dice by calling the 'rand' function and using the modulus
operator to limit the output to be in the range [1, 6]

Execution:
Run the program with './bin/dice' and enter an integer to set srand
