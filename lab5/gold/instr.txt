Instructions
************
Implement a function to multiply two matrices together. The sizes of the
matrices will be provided as arguments to the executable and the two matrices
being multiplied will be randomly generated. You will need to multiply these two
matrices and store the results in an output matrix.

matrix.c:matrix_multiply - 
Given the two input and one output matrix as arrays along with integers
specifying their dimensions, perform matrixC = matrixA * matrixB.

Execution:
Run the program as './bin/mat_mult m n k' where m, n, k are the dimensions of
the matrices.
