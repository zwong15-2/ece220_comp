Change <NAME> to your name to print out a simple message to the console.

This lab assignment is intended to give an overview of how to checkout, commit,
and push code to your Github repositories; provide a brief refresher on the
lc3tools; and illustrate the workflow for lab assignments.

All labs assignments will have the following structure:
* src - contains the source code for the assignment
* tests - contains individual test scripts and a script to run all the scripts
* instr.txt - this file that describes the lab assignment
* Makefile - file to compile code, run tests, and clean object files

The Makefile is a file that contains shell commands that can be used to compile
source code and perform other tasks. If you open the Makefile, you will see a
few labels followed by some shell commands. Below is a list of Make commands and
their functions:
* 'make' - executes the commands associated with the 'all' label which
  references the'dirs' and 'sources' labels. The 'dirs' label creates an 'obj'
  directory and the 'sources' label compiles your code and moves all object
  files to the 'obj' directory. 
* 'make clean' - removes the 'obj' directory and all object files(this may be
  useful in the future for C labs/MPs in some situations). 
* 'make test' - runs the 'runtests.sh' script in the 'tests' directory. This
  script runs all the individual tests and reports program's score against them.
